# Interpretation-of-Activation-Maps-in-Generative-Models

Welcome to the Rohde und Schwarz Competition repository dedicated to the interpretation of activation maps in generative models!

## Project Overview
Recent advancements in Explainable AI and Computer Vision have led to improved interpretability of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Techniques such as Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM have demonstrated the practicality of localized visual attention in classification and categorization tasks. However, limited research has been conducted on applying these methods to generative models.

In this project, we implement the Grad-CAM technique on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) models trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset. We aim to generate controllable human faces and perform semantic segmentation on these faces. Subsequently, we explore methodologies to enhance explainability by applying Explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM. Additionally, we analyze the effects of modifying model architectures, loss functions, and latent space sizes.

## Key Objectives
* Build generative models capable of generating controllable human faces.
* Apply Grad-CAM and other Explainable AI techniques to improve interpretability.
* Analyze the impact of altering model architecture, loss functions, and latent space sizes.
* Investigate latent space information by modifying latent node variables.
